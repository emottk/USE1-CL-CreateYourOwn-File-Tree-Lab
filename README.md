#Create Your Own File Tree!

Now that you've learned how to manipulate file trees with your command lines, create your own!		

Map out continents, countries, states, and capitals! Or categorize musical instruments! Maybe make a directory of other students in your class, organized by school and state. Whatever you feel could use some organization in this world - you have the power to get it done. 		

Inside this lab, `mkdir` whatever directory you want to start with and go from there.
